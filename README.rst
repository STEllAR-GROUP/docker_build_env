This repository automatically builds and tests a docker image that is suitable
to build HPX.

It gets built, tested and deployed with
`CircleCI <https://circleci.com/gh/STEllAR-GROUP/docker_build_env>`_.

If successfully built and tested, the final image gets deployed to Docker
and can be accessed with the image name **stellargroup/build_env:latest**.
